# CS:GO HP Indicator without Cheats!

This is not a cheat, this just utilises the -netconport launch option which allows for applications to connect to the game's console and read and send console commands.

## How it's working?
When you die, it writes in the team chat how much hp you took from the enemy

## How to use?
- add the launch option `-netconport 2121` to csgo
